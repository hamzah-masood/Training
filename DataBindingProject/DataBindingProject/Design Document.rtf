\f0\fs24 \cf0 I understood the the issue that needed to be addressed. You basically need to have a custom Notification Center, where you add an observer to see if there are any changes made in the textfield, and make a didst call, then update the label in the first view controller. The implementation however confused me a stop how to go about add all these things. I could use the didset for a class that would update the value in the first view controller.}
